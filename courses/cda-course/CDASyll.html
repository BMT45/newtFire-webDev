      <p>Tuesday, July 10, according to instructions from THE TIMES, I made up for the role of shop-girl, and with a list
         of factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down State street under a brown braise veil as impenetrable
         as an iron mask. I applied at two feather factories and three
         corset shops, but aside from the exercise up and down several
         flights of stairs got nothing. The feather people did not need any help and the corset
         folks had not started on the winter trade.

                  <apply-templates></apply-templates></span></bold>
         </workingConditions> The fifth place on my list was the “Western Lace Manufacturing Co.”
         218 State street. Ascending one flight of stairs I
         stopped to take off my veil and adjust my eyes to the low light. That done I looked
         about and finding a door marked ”Office of the Western Lace
         Manufacturing Co.” with “Come In” on the glass I complied.
      </p>
      
      <p>A young girl followed and leaving her
         to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about, and proceeded to perspire
         and
         scrutinize the place.

         </workingConditions> On a long table, that served
         as a sort of fortification for the private office of the company, were the
         samples—“antique crocheted good”—as they are listed, in various shades of white. All
         were of different pattern and unvarying ugliness. There were round tidies and oblong
         tidies, square mats for a bureau and smaller ones of oval and circular design, intended
         for a lamp or cushion. Behind the table, sachetiny between a writing stand and a desk,
         was a young man of 30 or so, of blonde type, with a stationary
         scowl between his eyebrows and  otherwise pleasing manner. That is, I
         thought the manner pleasing till I began to get acquainted with it and then my
         opinion changed. After a lapse of five minutes or so the fair-haired gentlemen turned to the young girl with a deepening of the  and a most
         unalluring <span class=""></span> opening
         a piece of newspaper and unfolding a dozen hand-made mats the size of a tea-plate.

         <span class=""></span></p>
      
      <p>As he went to lead the way the crochet-teacher called
         his attention, and the girl remaining I seized my chances for a bit of interviewing.
         Martha showed me her contract, in which 
         <workingConditions>
            <bold><span class="work">
                  <apply-templates></apply-templates></span></bold>
         </workingConditions>. On the back of the contract were the
         credit receipts of the company entered in lead pencil, dating from January to July. She told me she lived in
         Gross Park, away out on the West side that she helped her
         mother, and had been trying to earn $15 since
         January. She received

            <bold><span class="work">
                  <apply-templates></apply-templates></span></bold>
         </workingConditions>.
         <span class=""></span></p>
      
      <p>When Mr. Ford came from the work-room he was met by a
         boy who had brought in some work and was in a hurry to be off.
         <span class=""></span> The poor boy is gone.
         Martha sits in the back room the picture of  and the
         entry being made I am approached. I look like a beggar and that
         is what I am taken for, as, the pretty blonde secretary only scowls. He
         stands and looks down at me and I sit and look up at him waiting for the, lines in
         the
         handsome brow to deepen, the edge of the soft, brown mustache to curl, and the laconic,
         withering <span class=""></span>giving my cat-colored eyes a mater doloroso sort of a roll
         As he caught the seraphic expression some facial machinery gave a lurch that threw
         on
         side of his countenance bias for a second. Reaching to the desk he pulled out the
         following circular and handed it to me.
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p>
         <span class=""></span>
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Poor Mr. Ford was so furious by this time that I thanked him for his
         attention and bade him good afternoon. At the foot of the stairs I waited to tie my
         veil
         on and see how Martha fared, but at the expiration of thirty
         minutes she was still waiting for Mr. White and her .

                  <apply-templates></apply-templates></span></bold>
         </workingConditions>.
         All expressed a liking for the work but complained bitterly
         of the way the  gave out the work. For instance
         bedspreads paid $10
         a dozen, but not more than three spreads were given to a hand and one of these was
         the
         sample. The little tablemats paid 50 cents per dozen, but before a girl was able to crochet enough
         to live on she was obliged to take collars made of line thread in such an intricate
         pattern that it was an utter impossibility to earn $1 a month.

         </workingConditions> This fact does not appear in the circulars, and it is
         not  after the contract has been signed that the  tacties of the
         concern are understood.
      </p>
      
      <p>Several cases are on record at the Woman’s Protective agency, but no
         judgment has been obtained, as the agreement  valid be-fore the law. All that
         can be done in the matter is to warn the public against a  legally
         incorporated to grind the life out of the women and girls unfortunate enough to
         patronize it. At Rosenthal &amp; Co.’s and Rosenberg
         Bros. I applied for work and was told to report in the morning to sew on
         cloaks. The manager in Stein’s, on Market street, wanted
         bands and offered to engage me at once. I was most impudently catechized some seven
         inquires requiring as many false statements. What was my name, place of residence,
         last
         position, amount of wages received, state of my health, nativity, <span class=""></span> It was enough and I left the
         creature still anxious to solve the widow question. By the time I reached Ludden’s, 122 Market
         street, I was in a reckless frame of mind. <span class=""></span>
         John had eyes the color of calico and a complexion like an immature
         tomato. He led the way to the cottonades, which were cut,
         trimmed, and tied up in bundles of a dozen garments each. <span class=""></span></p>
      
      <p>At the Never-Rip Jersey Company I was told to apply
         at the factory 133 West Washington street. “Work is
         given out at 7:30 a. m.,” the clerk informed me, “and if you have any snap about you
         you
         can make a good living. By the way of getting the required snap I went home, ate my
         dinner, and was in bed at 8 o’ clock. The next morning I resumed
         the rags of poverty and at 7 o’clock made my debut as the factory hand.

                  <apply-templates></apply-templates></span></bold>
         </workingConditions>. The factory where the never-rip
         jerseys are made is at the corner of
         Washington and Union streets, with the elevator entrance in the rear and
         workroom in the fifth story. The girls began to arrive at 7 o’clock, and at every
         trip
         of the elevator some twenty or more were carried up-stairs. I took a chair in one
         of the
         machine rows, and for an hour did nothing but watch the preparations for work in that

         </workingConditions> Along the brick walls
         were nails, irregularly driven, on which the girls hung their hats and wraps, dresses
         and collars. Nearly every one took off her dress and waisit, turned it inside out,
         put
         it on a nail and put on a calico of old stuff shop suit. A few took off their corsets
         and nearly all the machine hands changed their shoes before work. On the stroke of
         7:30
         a bell rang, the power was turned on

         The faces were sad and so very, very pales that I shall
         never look at a jersey again without seeing
         them.

         </workingConditions> The work circulated in baskets—long chip hampers
         with stout-handles—that held a dozen, with room for five times that quantity.

      <p>If it had been the last change for life I don’t believe the girls
         would have worked any harder for salvation. Scarcely a head was raised from machine
         or lap.

         </workingConditions> At 8:40 the proprietor of the chair I was in
         asked me to vacate, and I walked down through the narrow aisles of
         sewing-women to the “forelady” and asked for work. She asked me if I wanted to
         take a machine, but I expressed a preference for finishing. I was given a numbers,
         a
         basket with five jerseys to finish, and a chair beside a girl
         named Hannah, who, being engaged by the way was told to “show me.”
         Hannah had blonde hair and talked with the brogue.

         Remembering the treachery of my shop clothes I ever wore filled the two hooks and
         eyes
         with sewing and after testing them proceeded to face the collar. I told Hannah about my misery, but she wisely said it was no
         fault of hers and went on with a

         </workingConditions> and at the end of two hours I had bound the
         arm-holes, faced the collar, tacked the front facing and the bustle piece, and put
         two
         patts of hooks and eyes in a black jersey.

         One little girl who had been stretching
         jerseys at 2
         cents each made a lunch on three graham crackers and a piece of custard
         pie, which she ate reading a paper-covered book. I counted thirty-seven girls with
         a
         lunch of dry bread, fifteen with sandwiches, and ten who ate cold pancakes.
         Twenty-three girls were without any luncheon whatever. During the
         intermission the elevator stopped running and no one left the building but myself.
         Less
         than ten minutes was spent over the wretched mea.

         I didn’t get any more work till 2 o’clock because the forelady was in the toilet-room having
         her bangs done up in paper. She was a pretty woman, by the way, with a good face and
         a shock of beautiful auburn hair. She had been in her position for six years and was
         drawing a salary of $35 a week. The girls had
         a good word for her generally, but she struck me as being a woman without
         heart. At her appearance I was given a basketful of
         jerseys to finish button-holes.

         </workingConditions>, at the end of which I won the heart of a little girl who sat at the end of my
         table facing the wall. She had been sitting still so long that I called out and asked
         if
         she were ill. “No. I haven’t any work.”

         </workingConditions> It was too hot to work; she was
         going away soon, she said, and didn’t care to do any more. “When did I begin? Today. I worked in a box-factory, but it
         was so dull I could only earn 16 cents a day.
         My mother wants me to pay her $2.50 a week board, but how could I with
         96 cents. This is no
         better. I came at 8 this morning and I have only made 11 cents. I am 21. Beaus? Yes, some. I have on
         steady fellow, but I don’t know if he will marry me. I hope he will. She
         told me he earned

         she ever loved.”

         Nothing of any importance occurred till someone passed the news
         that a girl was asleep in the closet. Half a dozen left their machines to look at
         her, Hannah, my mentor, among them. “Oh, you just ought to see
         her, fast asleep, with her mouth wide open.” It was more than I could stand.
         I threw my button-holes into the basket and went to the toiletroom.
      </p>
      
      <p> Sure enough, there was the poor girl sitting in the dirty place, her head resting
         against a folded apron, breathing in the foul air that reeked with filth and
         disease. The walls of the closet were black with pencil marks, the floor was strewn
         with lint and threads, and the pale face of the sleeper looked ghastly in the
         darkness. She had tied one end of a string to the latch and the other to the drop
         chain.

         After making her toilet she came over to my table as I sewed away at my button-holes
         she
         told me her story. <span class=""></span> At 5:30 work ceased.

         </workingConditions> I paid a
         nickel to have my corner swept, and finding it impossible to wash up sans towel and
         soap
         I got under my veil and rang the elevator. The pressers laughed and told me to try
         the
         stairs—five flights. Down I went. At the second I went into the salesroom to buy a
         jersey. One of the firm waited on me; his magnanimity was
         sublime. The identical black
         jersey that I had received 5 centsfor finishing was offered to me at $2. I declined.
