     <h3>The input text</h3>
         <p>For this assignment we’ll be using an XML file originally prepared by students in the Nell Nelson project team last fall. 
            We’ve modified it for use as an XSLT exercise, and the new version
            is available here at <a href="NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml">http://newtfire.org/dh/NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml</a>. You should
            right-click on this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. We’ll be
            using it for subsequent XSLT assignments, so keep a copy when you’re done with this one.
         </p>
      <p>Because this document (unlike our work with the Georg Forster Voyage File or the Digital Mitford Site Index) is not in a namespace,
         you should not add the <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and we do not need to alter &lt;oXygen&gt;'s default XSLT stylesheet template at all this time.</p>
      <p>To begin your XSLT stylesheet should look like this:</p>      
      <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
      xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
         xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math"
    exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"
    <span style="color:purple;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span>
         version="3.0"&gt;
    
         <span style="color:green;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"/&gt;</span>
    
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>
      <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
      <p>For this assignment you want to write an XSLT stylesheet that will transform the XML input document into an HTML document that consists of a table of companies, addresses, and working conditions. In order to create an HTML table, you need to know that a table in HTML is a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element that contains one <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> (<q>table row</q>) element for each row of the table. Each cell in the row is a <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> (<q>table data</q>) element for regular rows and a <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> (<q>table header</q>) element for the header row. You can
         read more about HTML tables at 
         <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">http://www.w3schoos.com/html/html_tables.asp</a>.</p>
         <p>The desired output will look like:</p>
         <div class="code">
            <!-- RJP: this is temp. just to see how it looks while I finish the XSLT--><table>
            <tr>
               <th>Company Name</th>
               <th>Address</th>
               <th>Working Conditions</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
         </table>
         </div>
      <p>The underlying raw HTML, which we generated by running XSLT, should look like this:</p>
      <pre>
         
         
      </pre>
      
      
      
      
     				
    
    
      <h3>Important</h3>
      <ul>
         <li><em>Before submitting your homework, you must run the transformation at home</em> to
            make sure the results are what you expect them to be. There’s a guide to running
            XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; on Obdurodon at <a
               href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html"
               title="How to run a transformation in oXygen"
               >http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html</a>. If you don’t get
            the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that you can post a query to our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer,
            though; you need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and
            what you think the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our
            own queries to coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description
            of the problem helps us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also
            encouraging you to discuss the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also
            helpful for the person who responds. Answering someone else’s
            inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s problem often helps us clarify matters for
            ourselves!</li>
         <li>When you complete this assignment, you need only submit your XSLT file to Courseweb, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. We will run your XSLT transformation to see what output it generates, so you do not need to submit your output file.</li>
      </ul>
