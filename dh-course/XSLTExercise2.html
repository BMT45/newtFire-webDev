      <h3>The assignment</h3>
      <p>Create an XSLT stylesheet that will transform <cite><a
         href="bad-hamlet.xml" title="Download bad-hamlet.xml">Bad Hamlet</a></cite> into
         a hierarchical outline of the titles of acts and scenes in HTML. This isn’t very
         interesting on its own, of course, but if you were transforming the entire document into
         HTML for publication on the web, this might serve as the skeleton. It might also stand
         on its own as a table of contents at the top of such a publication, so that the reader
         could click on the title of a scene to jump to that location in the file.</p>
      <p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you’re welcome to include more information, whether of a
         publication-oriented sort (e.g., speakers, speeches, stage directions, etc., as if you
         were publishing the entire play) or as a foray into exploration and analysis (e.g., list
         of characters who speak in each scene, perhaps with a count of their speeches, length of
         speeches, etc). The only required content of your homework, though, is the HTML outline
         of act and title chapters, which might look something like:</p>
