        <h3>The input text</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we’ll be using an XML file originally prepared by students in the Nell Nelson project team last fall. 
            We’ve modified it for use as an XSLT exercise, and the new version
            is available here at <a href="NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml">http://newtfire.org/dh/NelsonArticle_1888-07-30.xml</a>. You should
            right-click on this link, download the file, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. 
        </p>
        <p>Because this document is not in a namespace, you should not add the <code>@xpath-default-namespace</code> attribute, and we do not need to alter &lt;oXygen&gt;'s default XSLT stylesheet template at all this time.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we’re going to work with this entire document (on all levels of the hierarchy),
            concentrating on processing the in-line elements to style the text. You can use some of
            the basic HTML in-line elements, like <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for emphasis or
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for strong emphasis, but you’ll also want to use CSS to
            set some elements to different colors or background colors or borders or fonts or font
            sizes or font styles (e.g., italic) or font weights (e.g., bold) or text decoration
            (e.g., underlining) or text transformation (e.g., convert to all upper case) … well …
            anything else. We describe below how to do that.</p>
        <p>There are several types of in-line elements in the input XML document, for the purposes of this assignment we will focus on these few:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;femVoice&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code></li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;mascVoice&gt;</code></li>           
            
            <li><code>&lt;company&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some are immediately inside  <code>&lt;articleBody&gt;</code> and some sit inside other in-line elements like all of the voice tags sitting inside of <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> elements or <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> inside of <code>&lt;headLine&gt;</code> elements that sit typically (but not always) inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. You may not know at the outset which ones can be inside which other ones, or how deeply they can nest. Happily, with XSLT, unlike with many other programming languages, you don’t need to care about those questions!</p>
        
        
        <p>An example of possible desired output can be found here <a href="1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html">http://newtfire.org/dh/1888-07-30_XSLTresults.html</a>. It is important to note that the majority of the styling choices on this file are controlled with a CSS file. You will make your own CSS and relate it to your XSLT; therefore, your stylistic choices might vary greatly from ours and your ouput may look completely different. What will look more similar is the underlying raw HTML, which we generated by running XSLT. That should look like this: <!-- RJP: Since this is such a large file with a lot of text I am not really sure if it is best to just stick it into a <pre> element and have it taking up so much space. Probably would be better to have another link with the view source of the html page so students can see the <span> elements. ALSO important to note this is not valid HTML but I don't think it has to be, right? --></p>
        
        
        <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
        <h4>How to process richly mixed content</h4>
        <p>Prose paragraphs with in-line elements that might contain other in-line elements are
            richly mixed content, with varied and unpredictable combinations of elements and plain
            text. This is the problem that XSLT was designed to solve. With a traditional procedural
            programming language, you’d have to write rules like <q>inside this paragraph, if
                there’s a <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code> do X, and, oh, by the way, check whether
                there’s a <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> or a <code>&lt;company&gt;</code> inside
                the <code>&lt;dialogue&gt;</code>, etc.</q> That is, most programming languages
            have to tell you what to look for at every step. The elegance of XSLT when dealing with
            this type of data is that all you have to say inside paragraphs and other elements is
            <q>I’m not worried about what I'll find here; just process <strong>(apply templates to)</strong> all
                my children, whatever they might be.</q></p>
        <p>The way to deal with mixed content in XSLT is to have a template rule for every element
            and use it to output whatever HTML markup you want for that element and then, inside
            that markup, to include a general <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code>, not
            specifying a <code>@select</code> attribute. For example, if you want your
            <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> to be tagged with the HTML
            <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags, which means <q>strong emphasis</q> and which is
            usually rendered in bold, you could have a template rule like:</p>
        <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="nellVoice"&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
        <p>You don’t know or care whether <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> has any child nodes or, if
            it does, what they are. Whatever they are, this rule tells the system to try to process
            them, and as long as there’s a template rule for them, they’ll get taken care of
            properly somewhere else in the stylesheet. If there are no child nodes, the
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> will apply vacuously and harmlessly. As
            long as every element tells you to process its children, you’ll work your way down
            through the hierarchy of the paragraph without having to know which elements can contain
            which other elements or text nodes.</p>
        <h4>Taking stock: when to use <code>@select</code></h4>
        <p>In an earlier XSLT assignment, where you built HTML tables,
            you used <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="…"/&gt;</code>, specifying exactly what
            you wanted to process where. That makes sense when your input and output (an
            HTML table) are very regular in structure. <em>Use the <code>@select</code> attribute
                when you know exactly what you’re looking for and where you want to put it.</em></p>
        <p>In this assignment, on the other hand, you don’t know (and don’t need to know) the order
            and nesting hierarchy of whatever salad of elements and plain text you might find inside
            a paragraph or its subelements. You just want to process whatever comes up whenever it
            comes up. <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</code> without the <code>@select</code>
            attribute says <q>apply templates to whatever you find.</q>
            <em>Omit the <code>@select</code> attribute where you don’t want to have to think about
                and cater to every alternative individually.</em> (You can still treat them all
            differently because you’ll have different template rules to <q>catch</q> them, but when
            you assert that they should be processed, you don’t have to know what they actually
            are.)</p>
        <h4>What should the output look like</h4>
        <p>HTML provides a limited number of elements for styling in-line text, which you can read
            about at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp"
                >http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp</a>. You can use any of these in
            your output, but note that presentational elements, the kind that describe how text
            looks (e.g., <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for <q>italic</q>), are generally regarded as less
            useful than descriptive tags, which describe what text means (e.g.,
            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> for <q>emphasis</q>). Both of the preceding are normally
            rendered in italics in the browser, but the semantic tag is more consistent with the
            spirit of XML than the presentational one.</p>
        <p>The web would be a dull world if the only styling available were the handful of
            presentational tags available in vanilla HTML. In addition to those options, there are
            also ways to assign arbitrary style to a snippet of in-line text, changing fonts or
            colors or other features in mid-stream. To do that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Before you read any further in this page, read Obdurodon's <a
                href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/class-and-span.html">Using
                <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>@class</code> to style your HTML</a>
                page.</p></li>
            <li><p>To use the strategies described at that page, create an XSLT template rule that
                transforms the element you want to style to an HTML <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
                element with a <code>@class</code> attribute. For example, you might transform
                <code>&lt;nellVoice&gt;</code> in
                the input XML to <code>&lt;span
                    class="nellVoice"&gt;</code>...text node...<code>&lt;/span&gt;</code> in the output HTML. You
                can then specify CSS styling by reference to the <code>@class</code> attribute,
                as described in the page we link to above.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that you can make your transformations very specific. For example,
                        instead of setting all <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements to the same
                        HTML <code>@class</code>, you can create separate template rules to match on
                        workingConditions according to their attribute values. For example,
                        <code>&lt;xsl:template match="workingConditions[@category='positive']"&gt;</code> is
                        a normal XPath expression to match <code>&lt;workingConditions&gt;</code> elements
                        only if they have a <code>@category</code> attribute with the value
                        <q>positive</q>.</li>
                    <li>To really exercise your XPath skills, note that directly inside of the <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> element in the <code>&lt;toneElements&gt;</code>
                        the working conditions are described (with an <code>@tone</code> attribute) as
                        <q>good</q>, <q>bad</q>, or <q>neutral</q>. You can write a <strong>matching
                            rule</strong> that will <dfn>dereference</dfn> the <code>@category</code> attribute on,
                        say, <code>&lt;workingConditions category="positve"&gt;...text node...&lt;/workingConditions&gt;</code>,
                        look up whether this is a good, bad, or neutral tone, and set the
                        <code>@class</code> value accordingly. You could make all good working Conditions
                        one color and all bad working conditions a different color, letting XPath look up the
                        tone reference for you.</li>
                   
                </ul></li>
            <li><p>Setting the <code>@class</code> attributes in the output HTML makes it possible
                to style the various <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements differently according to
                the value of those attributes, but you need to create a CSS stylesheet to do
                that. Create the stylesheet (just as you‘ve created CSS in the past), and
                specify how you want to style your <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. Link the
                CSS stylesheet to the XSLT by creating the appropriate
                <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element inside of the HTML  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your XSLT (you can remind
                yourself of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element format by referencing the bottom of Obdurodon's <a
                    href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/css-intro.xhtml">Introduction to
                    CSS</a>).</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Your Final Results</h3>
        <p>What you should produce, then, is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An XSLT stylesheet that transforms the contents of the source document into HTML.</li>
            <li>The resulting HTML should style the seven types of in-line elements listed above. At
                least some of those styles should be set using <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements
                with the <code>@class</code> attribute.</li>
            <li>You need to create a CSS file, linked to your output HTML, that specifies how to
                style the output document. You can look up the most useful of the available CSS
                properties at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/"
                    >http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>. We’d suggesting following the links on the
                left under <q>CSS styling</q> for styling backgrounds, text, and fonts, as well as
                the link for borders under <q>CSS box model</q>.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Important</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Before submitting your homework, you must run the transformation at home</em> to
                make sure the results are what you expect them to be. There’s a guide to running
                XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; on Obdurodon at <a
                    href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html"
                    title="How to run a transformation in oXygen"
                    >http://dh.obdurodon.org/oxygen-xslt-configuration.html</a>. If you don’t get
                the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that you can post a query to our <a href="https://github.com/ebeshero/DHClass-Hub/issues">DHClass-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer,
                though; you need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and
                what you think the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our
                own queries to coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description
                of the problem helps us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also
                encouraging you to discuss the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also
                helpful for the person who responds. Answering someone else’s
                inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s problem often helps us clarify matters for
                ourselves!</li>
            <li>When you complete this assignment, you need to submit your XSLT file and CSS file to Courseweb, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. We will run your XSLT transformation to see what output it generates, so you do not need to submit your output file. However, it is important that you include your CSS so we can locally link it to your XSLT and see your final output</li>
