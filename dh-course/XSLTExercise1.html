      <p>Our very first XSLT assignment is an Identity Transformation, a kind transformation we have to do frequently in our projects when we need to make specific changes to our encoding. 
         To begin, download this XML file from our Pacific Voyage project that I have linked here: <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">ForsterGeorgComplete.xml</a>.
      </p>
      			
      <p>We often use an Identity transformation with Attribute Value Templates, in order to add attributes to elements like &lt;p&gt; or &lt;l&gt; that calculate a paragraph or line number. As an optional extra challenge for this assignment, read about <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/avt.xhtml">Attribute Value Templates</a> and see if you can figure out how to add paragraph numbers in the Georg Forster file and try adding a template rule to do that here. (Hint: I've posted <a href="">an example ID-transform stylesheet</a> that adds line numbers to a series of sonnets here.) We will return to this later, since you will be working with Attribute Value Templates in a later homework exercise.</p>
