        <p>You can find an XML (TEI) version of our Fall 2015 DH class syllabus at <a
                href="dhCDA-2015.xml">http://newtfire.org/dh/dhCDA-2015.xml</a>. Right-click to download and save
this file locally on your computer, and open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;.</p>
        <p>You should consult <cite class="sub"><a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/functions.xhtml"
                    >The XPath Functions We Use Most</a></cite> page and especially its section III.
            on Strings. Also, if you have the Michael Kay text, it may be useful to you here. As
            always, consult our class notes and our introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a
                    href="explainXPath.html">Follow the XPath!</a></cite>. After you’ve completed
            your homework, save your answers to a file and upload it to CourseWeb as an attachment.
            (Please use an attachment! If you paste your answer into the text box, CourseWeb may
            munch the angle brackets.) Some of these tasks are thought-provoking, and even
            difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can, and if you can’t get a working answer,
            give the answers you tried and explain where they failed to get the results you wanted.
            Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong, and even when it doesn’t, it
            will help us identify the difficult moments. These tasks require the use of path
            expressions, predicates, and functions. There may be more than one possible answer.</p>
        <p>Using the <cite>Pitt-Greensburg syllabus</cite> XML document and the XPath browser window
            in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, construct XPath expressions that will do the following (give the
            full XPath expressions in your answers, and not just the results):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                There are two books referenced in the syllabus using the tag <code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code>. What Xpath will
                return a comma-separated list of the authors?
                
            </li>


            <li>There are multiple authors of the book designated in the second <code>bibl</code> element, and they are introduced with the string "Authors:" Let's work on using the tokenize() function to remove the "Authors:" string. What Xpath function can we use to separate "Authors:" from the rest of the string and throw it away, yielding only 
                "Bruce Hyslop, Lenny Burdette, and Chris Casciano" in the result window? (Hints: You will need to refer to the colon punctuation here, and use parenthetical grouping with a predicate to first retrieve the second book only, and then to filter your final results.
            
            </li>


            <li><ol><li> Which 'div' elements contain references to 'homework'? How many results do you return?</li>
                <li>Can you figure out how to retrieve the immediate parent element containing the word "homework"? (Hint: it involves looking for any element below the div and then its text() node, since we need the element whose *text* contains the word "homework.")</li>
               </ol> 
          
            </li>
            
            <li><ol><li>What XPath returns all the Fridays on the syllabus? (Scroll through the document looking for the date elements to help determine this.)</li>
                <li>Now, what if we want to return those dates in their ISO format, as yyyy-mm-dd? Can you retrieve that with XPath? </li>
                <li>Return a string-joined list of all these dates, separated with a comma and a space.</li>
                
            </ol>  </li>

            <li> <ol><li>How many <code>div</code> elements of @type 'assign' contain references to word "GitHub"?</li> 
                <li>Find the longest and shortest div elements of this type (that contain the word "GitHub") in the document. How long
                and short are they? Hint: You will need to use min(), max(), and the string-length() function here, as well as some complex predicates.</li></ol>
</li>

        

            <!--  ebb:I'm not finding much documentation on format-date()! Save until we can actually *do* this one?-->
            <!--<li>Optional (but reccomended!) Challenge Question: Using the function format-date(), 
                Can you output all of the Friday dates on the syllabus? You’ll first need to change 
                your Oxygen path version to 3.0 next to the search box if it’s not already 3.0. 
                Then you’ll need to look up the details of format-date() on w3 schools. Be careful, because
                not all of the dates in our syllabus XML file are uniform or suitable for processing this way. To 
                simplify things you’ll want to look ONLY in divs of type ‘day’.</li>-->
