            <head>Coding and Digital Archives: Course Description</head>
            <p>This course is all about doing interesting things with texts using computers and
               digital technology. Your professors are researchers of literature and anthropology,
               not computer programmers, and we teach this course based on our experience with
               collaborating on digital humanities projects, some of which you may find on <ref
                  target="newtfire.org">http://newtfire.org</ref>. We teach this course with an
               emphasis on working with texts as artifacts of human culture shaped primarily with
               words and letters—the forms of "written" language transferable to many media
               (including image and sound) that we can study with computer tools that we design for
               ourselves based on the questions we ask. We work with computers in this course as
               precision instruments that help us to read and process great quantities of
               information, and that lead us to make significant connections, ask new kinds of
               questions, and build models and interfaces to change our reading and thinking
               experience as people curious about human history, culture, and creativity. </p>
            <p>Our class is one of the core courses of <ref
                  target="http://greensburg.pitt.edu/academics/info/digital-studies"
                  >Pitt-Greensburg's Digital Studies Certificate</ref>, and it satisifes a range of
               general education requirements in quantitative reasoning, behavioral sciences, and humanities. That is because this course is distinctively
               interdisciplinary, one of a very few available at Pitt, in engaging formal and
               quantitative reasoning through computer coding in ways that matter to students in
               humanities and social sciences who are not training to be computer scientists.
               Students gain hands-on experience in this course with applying computer coding to
               represent and investigate cultural materials. As we design projects together, you
               will gain practical experience in editing and you will certainly fine-tune your
               precision in writing and thinking.</p>
            <p> We will be working primarily with eXtensible Markup Language (XML) because it is a
               powerful tool for modelling texts that we can adapt creatively to our interests and
               questions. XML represents a standard in adaptability and human-readability in digital
               code, and it works together with related technologies with which you will gain
               working experience: You'll learn how to write XPath expressions: a formal language
               for searching and extracting information from XML code which serves as the basis for
               transforming XML into many publishable forms, using XSLT and XQuery. You'll learn to
               write XSLT: a programming "stylesheet" transforming language designed to convert XML
               to publishable formats, as well as XQuery, a query (or search) language for
               extracting information from XML files bundled collectively. You will learn how to
               design your own systematic coding methods to work on projects, and how to write your
               own rules in schema languages (like Schematron and Relax-NG) to keep your projects
               organized and prevent errors. You'll gain experience with an international XML
               language called TEI (after the Text Encoding Initiative) which serves as the
               international standard for coding digital archives of cultural materials. Since one
               of the best and most widely accessible ways to publish XML is on the worldwide web,
               you'll gain working experience with HTML code (a markup language that is a kind of
               XML) and styling HTML with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). We will do all of this with
               an eye to your understanding how coding works—and no longer relying without question
               on expensive commercial software as the "only" available solution, because such
               software is usually not designed with our research questions in mind. </p>
            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in digital project management and
               web development, and their digital projects will distinguish them as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               Your success will require patience, dedication, and regular communication and
               interaction with us, working through assignments on a daily basis. Your success will
               NOT require perfection, but rather your regular efforts throughout the course, your
               documenting of problems when your coding doesn't yield the results you want. Homework
               exercises are a back-and-forth, intensive dialogue between you and your instructors,
               and we plan to spend a great deal of time with you individually over these as we work
               together. Our guiding principle in developing assignments and working with you is
               that the best way for you to learn and succeed is through regular practice as you
               hone your skills. Our goal is not to make you expert programmers (as we are far from
               that ourselves). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to think your way
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions.</p>

                     writing code to achieve a specified result by applying a coding method you are
                     learning. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing the task. You

                     expected vs. what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Documenting
                     problems is key to the learning process, and sometimes the documentation

                     or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
                     or poorly designed. Good response papers demonstrate care and reflection, and

               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren't "know-it-all" experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <hi rend="em"
                     >Beginning by week two, we'll expect each student to post at least once per
                     week on our online class discussion board</hi>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Ask questions, make suggestions, share helpful
                  resources you've found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the discussion
                  boards give you all a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <hi
                     rend="em">always think of the discussion board as your first resource</hi> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
                  course credit as your participation grade.</p>

               <head>Quizzes and Tests (15%):</head>
               <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about six to
                  eight) short quizzes and tests that will take roughly half of the class period
                  time. These will ask you to demonstrate your knowledge of coding practices and
                  vocabulary learned in an immediately preceding portion of the course. We will drop
                  your lowest two scores on these exams. (No make-up exams are given: see course

               <head>Project (35%):</head>
               <p> Within the first three weeks of the course, we will familiarize you with some of
                  our ongoing projects and their associated research questions. These include the
                     <ref target="http://pacific.pitt.edu">Digital Archives and Pacific Cultures
                     Site</ref>, <ref target="http://mitford.pitt.edu">the Digital Mitford
                     Archive</ref>, and a site presenting <ref

                     variants in Emily Dickinson's Fascicle 16</ref>. You will be working in teams
                  to contribute to these ongoing projects, to develop a site of your own designed to
                  enhance these projects or take them in a new direction. The direction you take
                  will be partly shaped by you in conversation with the instructors.
                  <!--We will also assign you to
                  propose a project based on a text or set of texts that interest you and suggest a
                  promising research question to explore with our coding methods, and we'll respond
                  to these to help you refine your ideas. We'll ask you all to read each other's
                  refined proposals, and the class as a whole (working with the instructors) will
                  select which of these we want to pursue through the term, and form groups to begin
                  work.-->
                  Development of the project will involve doing a careful document analysis,
                  developing a coding plan and rules to follow, coding your text(s), and developing
                  programs to address your research question. It will also involve designing a
                  project site to represent your research questions, the texts and your processing
                  of them, as well as to share your coding scripts and to reflect on the results of
                  your investigation. We will post milestones you must meet for the projects
                  throughout the term. Project teams must meet 90% of the project milestone due
                  dates in order to receive a passing grade. It is expected that project teams meet
                  regularly (each week), check in with the instructors, and delegate tasks to each
                  other. Reporting on project progress is required as part of the regular homework
                  assignments for the course. Teams are encouraged to meet with us instructors
                  during (or outside) our scheduled office hours. In the last few weeks of the
                  course, almost all of your course work outside class will be devoted to project
                  development, applying the methods you've been learning across the semester.</p>

               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@pitt.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers

                  pitt.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official

                  <hi rend="em">Source Citation and Plagiarism:</hi> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious
                  consequences.</p>
               <p>Plagiarism falsely represents another source’s words or ideas as your own, and, if
                  you commit plagiarism in this course, you will receive a final course grade of F
                  and be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs. Representing the voice
                  of another individual as your own voice constitutes plagiarism, however generous
                  that person may be in “helping” you with an assignment. Turning in an assignment
                  generated collectively under the name of a single individual is considered
                  plagiarism. <hi rend="em">When instructed to collaborate on a project, project
                     collaborators share collective authorship and should identify themselves
                     directly as a team.</hi> To avoid plagiarism, cite your sources whenever you
                  quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital images from any outside
                  source (including websites, articles, books, course readings, Courseweb postings,
                  or someone else’s notes). When using the “copy” and “paste” features as you read
                  and research, be sure that you are carefully marking that these passages are
                  unprocessed from their source, so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to
                  do so not only produces sloppy work but (whether you intended it or not) results
                  in a false representation. As long as you make a good faith and clear effort to
                  cite your sources, you will not be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be
                  penalized if citations are inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information.
                  Cheating on exams or exercises will also receive a final course grade of F and
                  will be reported to the Vice President of Academic Affairs.</p>

                     <ref target="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/gazpacho">gazpacho soup</ref>. What if you were running a restaurant and needed to create
                     a system to file it according to ingredients to purchase, to track
                     quantities per unit serving--and this recipe were one of, say, 100 other
                     recipes you're keeping on file? Or, what if you needed to adapt it with
                     markup to fit a system like we see at the GitHub-based recipe center <ref
                        target="http://forkthecookbook.com/">ForktheCookbook.com</ref>? Think
                     about a good system for tagging the file for this long-term situation,
                     and mark up your file accordingly. Experiment with this and write a
                     complete XML file in a way that makes sense to represent the recipe, and
                     try to make use of elements as well as attributes in your markup. There
                     is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how
                     you nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the
                     relationship between elements and attributes in XML: Can the attributes
                     hold information from the main text, perhaps removing it from the body of
                     the text?) Submit the results on Courseweb, in the folder labelled
